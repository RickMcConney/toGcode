**üåê [Launch toGcode](https://rickmcconney.github.io/toGcode/)**

A web-based CNC CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) application that converts SVG files into G-code for CNC machines. Features AI-powered SVG generation, advanced path editing tools, and intelligent toolpath optimization. Designed with a focus on woodworking and maker-friendly CNC operations.

## üöß Work in Progress

This project is actively under development. Features and interfaces may change as the application evolves. While the core functionality is stable, new features and improvements are being added regularly.

Auto feed rate calculations are currently capped at 1000 mm/min. To adjust this value, go to the options panel and match it to your machine's capabilities. Alternatively, you can disable auto feed calculations, and the feed rate set on the individual tool will be used.

## Key Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Design**: Generate SVG designs from text descriptions using Google Gemini API, unfortunately generated images are primative
- üé® **Visual CAM Workflow**: Import SVG, design toolpaths, export G-code - all in your browser

- üîß **Complete Tool Library**: Manage unlimited tools with full parameter control
- üìê **Flexible Workpiece Setup**: Configure dimensions, material, origin position with visual feedback
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Smart Operations**: Inside/Outside profiling, Pocketing, Drilling, V-Carving with automatic tool compensation
- üéØ **Intelligent Feed Rates**: Auto-calculated speeds based on tool type and material properties
- üíæ **No Installation Required**: Runs entirely in the browser with localStorage persistence
- üñ±Ô∏è **Intuitive Interface**: Modern Bootstrap 5 UI with resizable panels and contextual help

- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for project persistence

### Key Components
- `js/cnc.js` - Core CNC logic and toolpath generation
- `js/bootstrap-layout.js` - Bootstrap 5 UI implementation and layout management
- `js/vcarve.js` - V-carve specific algorithms and optimization
- `js/operations/` - Operation system with individual tool implementations
  - `Operation.js` - Base operation class
  - `Select.js` - Selection and manipulation tool
  - `Transform.js` - Move, rotate, scale operations
  - `PathEdit.js` - Control point editing
  - `Workpiece.js` - Workpiece configuration interface
  - `Origin.js` - Origin setting tool
  - `Pan.js` - Canvas navigation
  - `Pen.js`, `Shape.js`, `Text.js`, `Drill.js` - Drawing tools
  - `Boolean.js` - Boolean operations (union, intersection, difference)

### Data Flow
1. **Import**: SVG files imported and parsed into internal path format using Paper.js
2. **Storage**: Paths stored in `svgpaths[]` array with selection, visibility, and bounding box data
3. **Configuration**: Workpiece dimensions and origin position stored in global `options[]` array
4. **Tool Selection**: Active tool selected from `tools[]` library with material-specific parameters
5. **Operation**: CNC operations generate toolpaths using ClipperJS for tool radius compensation
6. **Optimization**: Toolpaths optimized using Lighten algorithm and stored in `toolpaths[]` array
7. **Export**: G-code generated from toolpaths with proper feed rates, depths, and tool changes
8. **Persistence**: Project state (paths, toolpaths, tools, options) saved to browser localStorage

### Design Patterns
- **Operation System**: Object-oriented operation classes with inheritance
- **Event-Driven**: CncController manages mouse events and operation lifecycle
- **Properties Panel**: Dynamic UI generation from operation properties
- **State Management**: Global state with undo stack (serialized JSON snapshots)
- **Responsive Layout**: Bootstrap grid with resizable panels

## Getting Started

### Quick Start - Online Version
The easiest way to use toGcode is through the hosted version:

**üåê [Launch toGcode](https://rickmcconney.github.io/toGcode/)**

No installation required - just open the link in a modern web browser and start creating toolpaths!

### Local Development Setup

If you want to run toGcode locally or contribute to development:

#### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local web server (for development)

#### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rickmcconney/toGcode.git
   cd toGcode
   ```

2. **Start a local web server**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Or with Node.js
   npx http-server
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser

### Basic Usage

1. **Configure Workpiece**
   - Click the "Workpiece" tool in the sidebar
   - Set dimensions (width, length, thickness)
   - Choose wood species for optimized cutting parameters
   - Select origin position (typically middle-center)

2. **Import or Draw Paths**
   - Import an SVG file via Import SVG
   - Or use drawing tools (Pen, Polygon, Shape, Text) to create paths
   - Or generate SVG from text using the Gemini AI tool (requires free API key)

3. **Set Up Tools**
   - Switch to Operations panel and add or edit tools in the Tool panel at the bottom
   - Add or edit tools with diameter, feed rates, and depth settings
   - Select the tool you want to use

4. **Generate Toolpaths**
   - Select paths on the canvas
   - Choose an operation (Inside, Outside, Pocket, V-Carve, etc.)
   - Adjust parameters in the properties panel

5. **Export G-code**
   - Review toolpaths in the list
   - Simulate the tool paths with the play button
   - Choose or create a post-processor profile
   - Save the G-code file for your CNC machine

### Using AI-Powered SVG Generation

1. **Get a Gemini API Key** (free)
   - Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
   - Create a free API key

2. **Generate SVG from Text**
   - Click the "Gemini" tool in the sidebar
   - Enter your API key (stored securely in browser)
   - Type a description (e.g., "a decorative oak leaf", "a geometric mountain range")
   - Click Apply to generate and import the SVG
   - Unfortunately the Gemini models are not realy trained to generate SVG images so functionality is pretty limited

3. **Tips for Best Results**
   - Be specific and descriptive
   - Use technical drawing terms (e.g., "line drawing", "outline", "contours")
   - The AI generates stroke-based drawings optimized for CNC
   - Generated SVG is automatically imported and ready for toolpath operations
