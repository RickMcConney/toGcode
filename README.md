# toGcode

A web-based CNC CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) application that converts SVG files into G-code for CNC machines. Designed with a focus on woodworking and maker-friendly CNC operations.

## üöß Work in Progress

This project is actively under development. Features and interfaces may change as the application evolves. While the core functionality is stable, new features and improvements are being added regularly.

Auto feed rate calculatins are current clipped at 1000 mm/min. Please adjust this value in the options panel to match your machines capabilities. You can also disable auto feed calculations in the options panel, in which case the feed rate set on the individual tool will be used.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 with responsive layout
- **Geometry**: Paper.js for SVG parsing and geometric operations
- **Path Operations**: ClipperJS for offsetting and boolean operations
- **Typography**: OpenType.js for font handling
- **Icons**: Lucide icon system
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for project persistence

### Key Components
- `js/cnc.js` - Core CNC logic and toolpath generation
- `js/bootstrap-layout.js` - Bootstrap 5 UI implementation and layout management
- `js/vcarve.js` - V-carve specific algorithms and optimization
- `js/operations/` - Operation system with individual tool implementations
  - `Operation.js` - Base operation class
  - `Select.js` - Selection and manipulation tool
  - `Workpiece.js` - Workpiece configuration interface
  - `Origin.js` - Origin setting tool
  - `Pan.js` - Canvas navigation
  - `Pen.js`, `Polygon.js`, `Text.js`, `Drill.js` - Drawing tools
  - `OperationManager.js` - Operation lifecycle and event handling
- `js/CncController.js` - Main controller orchestrating operations and UI
- `js/ToolPropertiesEditor.js` - Dynamic properties panel system
- `js/StepWiseHelpSystem.js` - Contextual help and guidance system

### Data Flow
1. **Import**: SVG files imported and parsed into internal path format using Paper.js
2. **Storage**: Paths stored in `svgpaths[]` array with selection, visibility, and bounding box data
3. **Configuration**: Workpiece dimensions and origin position stored in global `options[]` array
4. **Tool Selection**: Active tool selected from `tools[]` library with material-specific parameters
5. **Operation**: CNC operations generate toolpaths using ClipperJS for tool radius compensation
6. **Optimization**: Toolpaths optimized using Lighten algorithm and stored in `toolpaths[]` array
7. **Export**: G-code generated from toolpaths with proper feed rates, depths, and tool changes
8. **Persistence**: Project state (paths, toolpaths, tools, options) saved to browser localStorage

### Design Patterns
- **Operation System**: Object-oriented operation classes with inheritance
- **Event-Driven**: CncController manages mouse events and operation lifecycle
- **Properties Panel**: Dynamic UI generation from operation properties
- **State Management**: Global state with undo stack (serialized JSON snapshots)
- **Responsive Layout**: Bootstrap grid with resizable panels
